The [Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/about/pacific-islands-fisheries-science-center) has started an underwater glider lab that will start with passive acoustic monitoring for cetaceans in the Pacific Islands region. This website is an in-development manual for all PIFSC glider activities. Please contact a member of the glider team with any questions.
