### Mapping resources

Various kmls and shapefiles relevant to the Pacific Islands Region are included in this repository or in the [shapefile_links.md](https://github.com/noaa-pifsc/glider-lab/blob/main/resources/mapping_resources/shapefile_links.md)

### WISPR PAM system resources

See the WISPR3 GitHub repo for the most up-to-date firmware, documentation, and helper functions: 
[https://github.com/embeddedocean/wispr3](https://github.com/embeddedocean/wispr3)

Specifically, this includes updated firmware files (and instructions to flash updated firmware) in the '[Release](https://github.com/embeddedocean/wispr3/tree/main/Release)' folder and manuals for the WISPR3 file format, serial command interface, and connector specs in the '[Docs](https://github.com/embeddedocean/wispr3/tree/main/Docs)' folder. 

For more information on installing, configuring, and controlling WISPR on a Seaglider, see our [WISPR page](wispr.qmd). 

### Random things...

This is a temporary placeholder for random bits of useful Seaglider info that we haven't fully organized yet. 

#### Test phone connection on Seaglider

- From the main menu `hardware > modem > remote`
- This will try to make a phone call only (without GPS or uploading anything)

#### Set up a new mission on seaglider.pub

This is done before a new actual mission or before any refurbishment or extensive testing and repairs in the lab. 

##### Create the new mission directory

- Navigate to the glider’s home directory e.g., `/home/jails/noaaosu/gliderjail/home/sgXXX`
- Use `NewMission.py` to create a new folder for this specific mission
  - The function will set up the mapping of the `current` folder so all newly created piloting files will be saved here when the glider calls in
  - It will also copy general files from the home directory like `pagers.yml`, all the files that start with `.` that we don’t really use except .pagers, and piloting files like `science`, c`mdfile`, `targets` and `sg_calib_constants.m`. The originals stay in the home directory but this provides a starting point for this particular mission
- To run the function use:

```default
basepy NewMission.py ./ <newMissionFolderName>

# note the above uses seaglider.pub's shortcut to map full python paths
# alternatively could use full paths
/opt/basestation/bin/python /usr/local/basestation3/NewMission.py ./ <newMissionFolderName>
```

- `<newMissionFolderName>` is the folder name should follow the format of the mission title string used in `sg_calib_constants.m` that includes the date (formatted `YYYYMMDD` and location or project (e.g., `20250918_tests`)
- Check that it was set up properly by running `ls -la` from the home directory and checking where the `current` folder points. 

##### Add the mission to `missions.yml`

Update the `missions.yml` to properly display this mission on the `seaglider.pub` vis

The syntax is very specific and errors can be difficult to debug so it is best practice to create a backup copy before making any changes.

- Navigate to your user folder (`/home/jails/noaaosu/username`) and use `cp ../gliderjail/home/missions.yml missions.orig` to create a backup of the existing `missions.yml` in your user directory
- Navigate to `/home/jails/noaaosu/gliderjail/home`
- Open `missions.yml` for editing (using `vi` or `nano`)
- Copy the previous mission to the `# past missions` section if needed
- Mark the previous mission as complete by adding the line `status: complete`
- Update the mission name and folder path in the `# current missions section`

Example syntax:

```default
# long form
  - 
    glider: 680
    mission: CalCurCEAS_Sep2024
    path: sg680/2024-09-14_CalCurCEAS_Sep2024
    also: [ {asset: newport} ]
    
# condensed
  - { glider: 680, mission: CalCurCEAS_Sep2024, path: sg680/2024-09-14_CalCurCEAS_Sep2024, status: complete}
```
