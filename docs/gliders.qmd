title: Gliders
---

We have two Seaglider SGX gliders. These gliders were developed at the University of Washington Applied Physics Laboratory and are currently manufacturered and supported by the [Integrated Observational Platforms (IOP) group at UW-APL](https://iop.apl.washington.edu/seaglider.php). These buoyancy driven, autonomous underwater gliders are capable of diving to 1000 m, survey 15-20 km per day, and can be deployed for many weeks. Each glider is equipped with an RBR Legato CTD and [WISPR passive acoustic monitoring](wispr.qmd) sensor.
